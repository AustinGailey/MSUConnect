]# MSUConnect
#### A Uni Social Application

The MSUConnect application will make students more connected to their peers. With a tri-school commuter campus, it can be difficult to bring students together from semester to semester. This project aims to bridge that gap by connecting peers through a mobile friendly application or a website. There will be modular additions to the project which will give the project a wide breadth of options for my team to choose from.

The novel aspect to the software is the implementation of shared location data and a social profile to connect students on campus. Your location will be shared when you are connected to the Universityâ€™s Wifi - Enabling students to get connected to peers and
campus events. Other data shared will be: if they are in a common area, a bitmoji would share your profile information with peers that are also sharing data. This would help to bring students together based on sharing common ground. A future feature could allow users to specify labeled study areas that would be shared app wide. In addition to the strategic use of location data, local companies and facilities can broadcast their events including times and locations to help generate student interest.
